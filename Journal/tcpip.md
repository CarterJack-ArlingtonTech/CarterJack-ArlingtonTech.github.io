# The TCP/IP Model

The model has four layers:

## Application

The Application layer is the top layer, or the one that is closest to the user. This is where user facing applications interact with the network. Some of the protocols in this layer layer include HTTP/HTTPS(For transferring webpages, which stand for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure), SMTP(For sending and recieving emails, which stands for Secure Mail Transfer Protocol), DNS(For looking up the IP adress for different domain names, it stands for Domain Name Service), and FTP(Which is used for transferring files, it stands for File Transfer Protocol)


## Transport

The Transport layer manages data that is transfered between different applications, using protocols like TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) UDP(User Datagram Protocol)

## Internet

The Internet layer is responsible for addressing, routing, and packaging data packets, known as IP datagrams. It ensures that data is sent from the source to the destination. Key components include:

- **IP (Internet Protocol):** The primary protocol responsible for addressing and routing packets.
- **Routers:** Devices that forward packets between different networks.

## Link (Network Access)

Protocols in this layer include:

- Wifi
- Bluetooth
- LTE
- Ethernet
